# Unit Testing Project

## Overview

This project is a demonstration of unit testing in a .NET Core application. Unit testing is a critical aspect of software development that helps ensure the correctness and reliability of your code by testing individual units or components in isolation.

In this project, we have implemented a sample .NET Core application and created a suite of unit tests using the xUnit testing framework. These tests cover various aspects of the application's functionality to verify that each component behaves as expected.

## Features

- **Unit Tests**: We have created a comprehensive set of unit tests that cover different parts of the application, including:
  - Business logic functions
  - Data access and repository methods
  - API controllers and endpoints
- **xUnit Testing Framework**: We have used the xUnit testing framework for writing and executing unit tests. xUnit is a popular and extensible testing framework for .NET applications.
- **Mocking**: We demonstrate the use of mocking frameworks (e.g., Moq) to isolate units of code for testing, enabling us to control and verify interactions with dependencies.
- **Faker**: We demonstrate the use of Faker nuget package (e.g., Bogus) to create fake objects for testing, Generate the multiple ramdom objects with help of this package.
- **Test Runners**: You can run the unit tests using popular test runners such as Visual Studio Test Explorer, dotnet test CLI command, or continuous integration (CI) pipelines.
